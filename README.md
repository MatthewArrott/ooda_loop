## Introduction

Notes from the book Science, Strategy and War: The strategic theory of John Boyd. By Frans P.B. Osinga.

John Boyd is often known for the so-called ‘OODA’ loop model he developed. This model refers to a decision-making process and to the idea that military victory goes to the side that can complete the cycle from observation to action the fastest.



## OODA loop: observe, orient, decide, act

The OODA loop is the cycle of observe, orient, decide, act. The approach explains how agility can overcome raw power. Compare it to the plan–do–check–act (PDCA) cycle or Shewhart cycle.

The loop states that decision-making occurs in a recurring cycle of observe–orient–decide–act. An entity (whether an individual or an organization) that can process this cycle quickly, observing and reacting to unfolding events more rapidly than an opponent, can thereby "get inside" the opponent's decision cycle and thus gain advantages.

The OODA loop was developed by military strategist John Boyd, to explain how to direct one's energies to defeat an adversary and survive. Boyd emphasized that "the loop" is actually a set of interacting loops that are to be kept in continuous operation during combat. Boyd also indicated that the phase of the battle has an important bearing on the ideal allocation of one's energies. Boyd's views on the OODA loop are much deeper, richer, and more comprehensive than the common interpretation of the "rapid OODA loop" idea.


## OODA loop: the strategic theory

In any conflict all combatants go through repeated cycles of observation, orientation, decision, action. The potentially victorious combatant is the one with the cycles which are consistently quicker than his opponent, including the time required to transition from one cycle to the next.

In order to generate the tempo of operations that we desire, and to best cope with the uncertainty, disorder, and fluidity of combat, command and control must be decentralized.

The aim of a strategist is not so much to seek battle as to seek a strategic situation so advantageous that if it does not of itself product the decision, its continuation by a battle is sure to achive this.


## OODA loop for business

The same OODA loop operates in a competitive business landscape, and the same logic applies. 

Decision makers gather information (observe).

Decision makers then form hypotheses about markets, customers, products, activities, and the intentions of competitors (orient).

Decision makers then make decisions, and act on them. 

The cycle is repeated continuously, and favors business agility over raw power. The aggressive and conscious application of the process gives a business advantage over a competitor who is merely reacting to conditions as they occur or has poor awareness of the situation. 


## Three spheres: physical, mental, moral

Boyd used a concept of three spheres of war: the physical, the mental, and the moral dimension, using this idea of to structure his argument and develop three modes of conflict. 

Respectively, these spheres dealt with destruction of the enemy's physical strength (fighting power), disorganization of his mental processes (thinking power), and disintigraion of his moral will to resist (staying power). The forces operating within these spheres did so in synergistic ways, not isolated ways.

Boyd emphasized speed, tempo, variety, surprise, trust, initiative, movement, and his view that the moral and mental dimensions came before technology, superiority in numbers, and massed firepower.


## Process to evolve

An important feature of Boyd's book of air maneuvers was that Boyd did not advocate one maneuver over another, but presented the options available to the pilot and his opponent in relation to each other. He wanted to show people a variety of moves and countermoves, and the logic of its dynamic.

His aim was not to convince people about the validity of this or that doctrine, but instead to create among his audience a way of thinking, a thought process.

The process not only creates the output but also represents the key to evolve the tactics, strategies, goals, unifying themes, etc. that permit us to actively shape and adapt to the unfolding world.
